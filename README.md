# Enhanced Admin Grids


Enhanced Admin Grids extension for Magento.
More informations about the extension can be found on its Magento Connect page here : https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/enhanced-admin-grids-editor.html

_The new version is now under development, and should include :_
- first wave of massive code refactoring (goals: clean-up almost every part of the code for a better maintainability, more consistency, more independence, better practices and a smaller footprint)
- refined permissions
- profiles system (for each grid, will allow to use different columns lists and parameters, assignable to different roles)
- advanced filtering possibilities for text and options columns
- in-grid customizations saved via Ajax, so that the pages do not (annoyingly) reload when customizations are saved from (eg) a product view tab

No time frame for the moment, but a development version should hopefully be available within a month or two
